# Api Exercise
Build a simple app using the technology of your choice and integrate the following features using the public IUCN Red List API.

**API - IUCN Red List of Threatened Species**

## ToDo
1. Load the list of the available regions for species
2. Take a random region from the list
3. Load the list of all species in the selected region — the first page of the results would suffice, no need for pagination
4. Create a model for “Species” and map the results to an array of Species.
5. Filter the results for Critically Endangered species:
   - Fetch the conservation measures for all critically endangered species
   - Store the “title”-s of the response in the Species model as concatenated text property. 
   - Print/display the results
6. Filter the results (from step 4) for the mammal class 
   - Print/display the results
