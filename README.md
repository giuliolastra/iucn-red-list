# Api Exercise
Build a simple app using the technology of your choice and integrate the following features using the public IUCN Red List API.

**API - IUCN Red List of Threatened Species**

## ToDo
- [X] Load the list of the available regions for species
- [X] Take a random region from the list
- [X] Load the list of all species in the selected region — the first page of the results would suffice, no need for pagination
- [X] Create a model for “Species” and map the results to an array of Species.
- [ ] Filter the results for Critically Endangered species:
  - Fetch the conservation measures for all critically endangered species
  - Store the “title”-s of the response in the Species model as concatenated text property. 
  - Print/display the results
- [ ] Filter the results (from step 4) for the mammal class 
  - Print/display the results


## Extra ToDo
- Style all
